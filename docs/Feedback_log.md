Time: 01/08/2019

Sourse: Richard

Action: Did research on ethics in medical field and evaluated risk beforehand, would try our best to build a safe connection between the VR device and the web server. Will keep an eye on the issue all the time and take action immediately once any unexpected problem is raised.
