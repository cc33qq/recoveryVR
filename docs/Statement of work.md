# Statement of work
## RecoveryVR
### Purpose
RecoveryVR is a start-up business operating out of the Griffin Accelerator. Our work on increasing the functionality of the system will make a huge difference not only to the success of the company but also to the ability of a doctor to help their patient and increase recovery rates from neurological injury. 

RecoveryVR is designed to help stroke survivors but our initial market research shows that this system will be hugely beneficial to people with complex regional pain, parkinsons, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury and motor neuron disease. Plus assist with fall prevention and phantom limbs.
