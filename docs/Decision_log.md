# Decision log
## Using Agile as development method - 01/08/2019
Proposed member: Xin Kan

Reasoning: Our project is a startup project and our members have little experience with our jobs. So our team can not give a concrete schedule of the work which means our team can not use the waterfall design method.

Outcome: All members agreed
